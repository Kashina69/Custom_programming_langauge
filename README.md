# RawScript
RawScript is a custom programming language which i am working on which can convert a english and convert it into python javascript golang or rust code

Raw Script because it is showing its Raw Nature and its a Scripting language  


## If you want to try it out just download the source code then in the directory run the file and give the english code.txt file as the command line input 

```
C:\>python main.py ./englishcode.txt
```

### The English code file should be in the same directory or you have to give the exact path of it 

## In the english code file write this to set the programming language in which you want the output it must be the first line
```

```
